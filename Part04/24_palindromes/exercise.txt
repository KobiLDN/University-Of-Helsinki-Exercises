Please write a function named palindromes, which takes a string argument and returns True if the string is a palindrome. Palindromes are words which are spelled exactly the same backwards and forwards.

Please also write a main function which asks the user to type in words until they type in a palindrome:

Sample output
Please type in a palindrome: python
that wasn't a palindrome
Please type in a palindrome: java
that wasn't a palindrome
Please type in a palindrome: oddoreven
that wasn't a palindrome
Please type in a palindrome: neveroddoreven
neveroddoreven is a palindrome!

NB:, the main function should not be within an if __name__ == "__main__": block
