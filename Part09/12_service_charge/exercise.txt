Please create a class named BankAccount which models a bank account. The class should contain

a constructor which takes the name of the owner (str), account number (str) and balance (float) as arguments
a method deposit(amount: float) for depositing money to the account
a method withdraw(amount: float) for withdrawing money from the account
a getter method balance which returns the balance of the account
The class should also contain the private method

__service_charge(), which decreases the balance on the account by one percent. Whenever either of the methods deposit or withdraw is called, this method should also be called. The service charge is calculated and subtracted only after the actual operation is completed (that is, after the amount specified has been added to or subtracted from the balance).
All data attributes within the class definition should be private.

You may use the following code for testing your class:

account = BankAccount("Randy Riches", "12345-6789", 1000)
account.withdraw(100)
print(account.balance)
account.deposit(100)
print(account.balance)
