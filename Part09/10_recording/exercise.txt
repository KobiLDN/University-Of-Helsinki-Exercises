Please create a class named Recording which models a single recording. The class should have one private variable: __length of type integer.

Please implement the following:

a constructor which takes the length as an argument
a getter method length which returns the length of the recording
a setter method which sets the length of the recording
It should be possible to make use of the class as follows:

the_wall = Recording(43)
print(the_wall.length)
the_wall.length = 44
print(the_wall.length)
Sample output
43
44

If the argument for either the constructor or the setter method is below zero, this should raise a ValueError.

If you need a refresher on raising exceptions, please see part 6 of the course materials.
