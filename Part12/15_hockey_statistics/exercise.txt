In this exercise you will build an application for examining hockey league statistics from the NHL in a couple of different ways.

The exercise template contains two JSON files: partial.json and all.json. The first of these is mostly meant for testing. The latter contains a lot of data, as all the NHL player stats for the 2019-20 season are included in the file.

The entry for a single player is in the following format:

{
    "name": "Patrik Laine",
    "nationality": "FIN",
    "assists": 35,
    "goals": 28,
    "penalties": 22,
    "team": "WPG",
    "games": 68
}
Both files contain a list of entries in the above format.

If you need a refresher on handling JSON files, please take a look at part 7 of this course material.

Search and list
Please write an interactive application which first asks for the name of the file, and then offers the following functions:

search by name for a single player's stats
list all the abbreviations for team names in alphabetical order
list all the abbreviations for countries in alphabetical order
These functionalities grant you one exercise point. Your application should now work as follows:

Sample output
file name: partial.json
read the data of 14 players

commands:
0 quit
1 search for player
2 teams
3 countries
4 players in team
5 players from country
6 most points
7 most goals

command: 1
name: Travis Zajac

Travis Zajac         NJD   9 + 16 =  25
command: 2
BUF
CGY
DAL
NJD
NYI
OTT
PIT
WPG
WSH

command: 3
CAN
CHE
CZE
SWE
USA

command: 0

NB: the printout format for a player must be exactly as follows:

Sample output
Leon Draisaitl       EDM  43 + 67 = 110
Connor McDavid       EDM  34 + 63 =  97
Travis Zajac         NJD   9 + 16 =  25
Mike Green           EDM   3 +  8 =  11
Markus Granlund      EDM   3 +  1 =   4
123456789012345678901234567890123456789
The last line in the sample above is there to help you calculate the widths of the different fields in the output; you should not print the numbers line yourself in your final submission.

The abbreviation for the team is printed from the 22nd character onwards. The + sign is the 30th character and the = sign is the 35th character. All the fields should be justified to the right edge. All whitespace is space characters.

F-strings are probably the easiest way to achieve the required printout. The process is similar to this exercise from part 6.

List players by points
These two functionalities will grant you a second exercise point:

list players in a specific team in the order of points scored, from highest to lowest. Points equals goals + assists
list players from a specific country in the order of points scored, from highest to lowest
Your application should now work as follows:

Sample output
file name: partial.json
read the data of 14 players

commands:
0 quit
1 search for player
2 teams
3 countries
4 players in team
5 players from country
6 most points
7 most goals

command: 4
team: OTT

Drake Batherson      OTT   3 +  7 =  10
Jonathan Davidsson   OTT   0 +  1 =   1
command: 5
country: CAN

Jared McCann         PIT  14 + 21 =  35
Travis Zajac         NJD   9 + 16 =  25
Taylor Fedun         DAL   2 +  7 =   9
Mark Jankowski       CGY   5 +  2 =   7
Logan Shaw           WPG   3 +  2 =   5
command: 0

Most successful players
These two functionalities will grant you a third exercise point:

list of n players who've scored the most points
if two players have the same score, whoever has scored the higher number of goals comes first
list of n players who've scored the most goals
if two players have the same number of goals, whoever has played the lower number of games comes first
Your application should now work as follows:

Sample output
file name: partial.json
read the data of 14 players

commands:
0 quit
1 search for player
2 teams
3 countries
4 players in team
5 players from country
6 most points
7 most goals

Jakub Vrana          WSH  25 + 27 =  52
Jared McCann         PIT  14 + 21 =  35
command: 6
how many: 5

Jakub Vrana          WSH  25 + 27 =  52

Travis Zajac         NJD   9 + 16 =  25
Conor Sheary         BUF  10 + 13 =  23

John Klingberg       DAL   6 + 26 =  32
