In this exercise you will create a small expansion to the phone book application. The code from the above example is in the exercise template. Please add a command which lets the user search the phone book by number. After the addition the application should work as follows:

Sample output
commands:
0 exit
1 add entry
2 search
3 search by number

command: 1
name: Eric
number: 02-123456

command: 1
name: Eric
number: 045-4356713

command: 3
number: 02-123456
Eric

command: 3
number: 0100100
unknown number

command: 0

Please implement this addition with respect to the current structure of the program. This means that in the PhoneBookApplication class you should add an appropriate helper method to allow for the new functionality, and also add a new branch to the while loop. In the PhoneBook class you should add a method which allows for searching with a number.

NB: as you test your program and end up with lots of different numbers stored in the phonebook.txt file, there is a chance the local tests will not be passed if conflicting data is read from the file as the app starts. You can try emptying the contents of any phonebook.txt files you find in the directory for the exercise before running the local tests. Which one of the files is used by your program may depend on your Visual Studio Code settings. Please have a look at the explanation in part 6. If your solution is correct, the tests on the server should still pass normally, regardless.
