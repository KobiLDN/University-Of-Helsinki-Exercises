The exercise template contains a class definition for a Rectangle. It represents a rectangle shape. A Rectangle works like this:

rectangle = Rectangle(2, 3)
print(rectangle)
print("area:", rectangle.area())
Sample output
rectangle 2x3
area: 6

Square
Please define a class named Square which inherits the Rectangle class. The sides of a square are all of equal length, which makes the square a special case of the rectangle. The new class should not contain any new attributes.

A Square object is used as follows:

square = Square(4)
print(square)
print("area:", square.area())
Sample output
square 4x4
area: 16
