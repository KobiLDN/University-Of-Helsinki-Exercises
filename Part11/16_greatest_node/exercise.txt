Please write a function named greatest_node(root: Node) which takes the root node of a binary tree as its argument.

The function should return the node with the greatest value within the tree. The tree should be traversed recursively.

Hint: the function sum_of_nodes in the example above may come in handy.

An example of how the function should work:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tree = Node(2)

    tree.left_child = Node(3)
    tree.left_child.left_child = Node(5)
    tree.left_child.right_child = Node(8)

    tree.right_child = Node(4)
    tree.right_child.right_child = Node(11)

    print(greatest_node(tree))
Sample output
11
