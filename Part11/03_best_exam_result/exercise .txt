The exercise template contains the class definition ExamResult. The class has the following public attributes:

name
grade1
grade2
grade3
Please write a function named best_results(results: list) which takes a list of ExamResult objects as its argument.

The function should return a new list containing only the best result from each ExamResult object. The function should use a list comprehension to achieve this.

The maximum length of the function is two lines of code, including the header line beginning with the def keyword.

The function should work as follows:

result1 = ExamResult("Peter",5,3,4)
result2 = ExamResult("Pippa",3,4,1)
result3 = ExamResult("Paul",2,1,3)
results = [result1, result2, result3]
print(best_results(results))
