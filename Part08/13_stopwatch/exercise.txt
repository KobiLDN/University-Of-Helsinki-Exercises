The exercise template contains the following skeleton for the Stopwatch class:

class Stopwatch:
    def __init__(self):
        self.seconds = 0
        self.minutes = 0
Please add to the class definition so that it works as follows:

watch = Stopwatch()
for i in range(3600):
    print(watch)
    watch.tick()
Sample output
00:00
00:01
00:02
... many more lines printed out
00:59
01:00
01:01
... many, many more lines printed out
59:58
59:59
00:00
00:01

So, the method tick adds one second to the stopwatch. The maximum value for both seconds and minutes is 59. Your class definition should also contain a __str__ method, which returns a string representation of the state of the stopwatch, as shown in the example above.

Hint: it might make it easier to test the tick method if you temporarily set the initial values of the seconds and minutes to some value closer to 59 in the constructor. If you do change the initial values, remember to change them back before submitting.
