Please write a function named older_book(book1: Book, book2: Book) which takes two objects of type Book as its arguments. The function should print out a message with the details of whichever is the older. It should print out a different message if the two books were written in the same year. Please see the examples below.

python = Book("Fluent Python", "Luciano Ramalho", "programming", 2015)
everest = Book("High Adventure", "Edmund Hillary", "autobiography", 1956)
norma = Book("Norma", "Sofi Oksanen", "crime", 2015)

older_book(python, everest)
older_book(python, norma)
Sample output
