Please define the class Pet. The class should include a constructor, which takes the initial values of the attributes name, species and year_of_birth as its arguments, in that specific order.

Please also write a function named new_pet(name: str, species: str, year_of_birth: int) outside the class definition. The function should create and return a new object of type Pet, as defined in the class Pet.

An example of how the function is used:

fluffy = new_pet("Fluffy", "dog", 2017)
print(fluffy.name)
print(fluffy.species)
print(fluffy.year_of_birth)
Sample output
Fluffy
dog
2017
