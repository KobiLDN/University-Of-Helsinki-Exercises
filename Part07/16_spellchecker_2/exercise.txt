In this exercise you will write an improved version of the Spell checker from the previous part.

Just like in the previous version, the program should ask the user to type in a line of text. Your program should then perform a spell check, and print out feedback to the user, so that all misspelled words have stars around them. Additionally, the program should print out a list of suggestions for the misspelled words.

Please have a look at the following two examples.

Sample output
write text: We use ptython to make a spell checker

We use *ptython* to make a spell checker
suggestions:
ptython: python, pythons, typhon
Sample output
write text: this is acually a good and usefull program

this is *acually* a good and *usefull* program
suggestions:
acually: actually, tactually, factually
usefull: usefully, useful, museful
The suggestions should be determined with the function get_close_matches from the Python standard library module difflib.

NB: For the automatic tests to work correctly, please use the function with the "default settings". That is, please pass only two arguments to the function: the misspelled word, and the word list.
